		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<p>I am currently a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering
           at SGSITS, Indore.</p>

         <p>Alongside my studies, I am actively engaged as a Associate Program Manager in Club Kshitij, the official cultural
           club of SGSITS. This role has allowed me to hone my organizational skills and collaborate with diverse teams to create
           memorable cultural events and experiences for our college community.</p>

        <p>My passion for technology extends to Artificial Intelligence (AI), where I am particularly fascinated by its applications
           in Machine Learning. I believe AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve efficiency across various sectors.</p>
           
         <p>Beyond academics, I am an avid dancer and have participated in numerous dance competitions and performances.
            Dance is not just a hobby but a creative outlet that allows me to express myself and collaborate effectively within teams,
            both essential skills in engineering and cultural coordination.</p>

         <p>Through my experiences and ongoing education, I am preparing to embark on a career where I can leverage my skills in
            electronics and telecommunication to make meaningful contributions to the industry.</p>

         <p>I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
